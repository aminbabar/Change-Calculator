-- Function usaChange calculates the minimum amount of coins needed of each
-- denomination given a certain amount. 
-- Function  change takes a list of positive Integers representing Haskellandâ€™s coin
-- denominations, and an Integer x representing the monetary value of the change that needs to
-- be made. and returns a list of integers indicating how many coins of each
-- denomination to return.
-- Collaborated with Amr Abdelhady

-- Calculates the number of coins used for each denomination in a coins list by using div and mod.
-- Calculates recursively so that it can keep track of n. Greedy Algorithm used. List returned by
-- this function will be referred to as coinsList in the rest of the program.

-- Calculates the frequency of one element in the denom list in the coinsList by using filter
-- (with partially applied function) on coinsList.
